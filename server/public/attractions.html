                <h2>Statue of Liberty</h2>
                <p>The Statue of Liberty, a gift from France to the United States, is one of the most 
                    recognizable symbols of freedom and democracy in the world. Standing on Liberty 
                    Island in New York Harbor, this colossal neoclassical sculpture was designed by 
                    Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and dedicated in 1886. Visitors can explore the pedestal 
                    and even climb to the crown for panoramic views of New York City and the harbor.
